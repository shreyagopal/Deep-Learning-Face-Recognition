# **Face Detection**

Face detection is the ability to detect and locate human faces in a photograph. Face detection is the first step in face recognition. Before we can identify a 
person's face, we need to be able to locate it in the photograph. If you've used a camera recently, you might have seen face detection in action. Face detection
is a great feature for cameras. When the camera can automatically pick out faces in a picture, it can make sure that all the faces are in focus before it takes 
the picture. But we'll use face detection for a different purpose. We'll use it to extract each face from the photograph and pass it to the next step in our 
face recognition pipeline.
 
The easiest way to locate objects in an image is to build a **sliding window classifier**. It has two steps. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The first step, we'll build a simple face detection model using a machine learning model. All this model can do is look at a small image<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tell if it's a face or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The second step is to slide the simple face detector across a larger image. At each spot in the image, we'll check if a face is detected.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a face is detected, we'll record the location of the face. This is called a sliding window classifier
because we're looking at one area,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or window, of an image at a time, and then we are sliding that 
window around the bigger image until we find the face.

# **Face Detection Algorithms**
There are several classification algorithms we can use to detect if a region of an image contains a face. The three of the most common algorithms are:
* Viola-Jones
* Histogram of oriented gradients or HOG
* Convolutional neural networks (CNN). 

The important part to remember is that face detection is its own separate step in our face recognition pipeline. You can implement this step with whichever 
face detection algorithm is the best fit for your project's hardware and performance requirements. 

## **Viola-Jones Algorithm**
* The Viola-Jones algorithm was invented in the early 2000s by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. 
* This algorithm uses a machine learning algorithm called a **decision tree**, and tries to see if dark and light regions appear in an image in a pattern 
consistent with a face. 
* The advantage of the Viola-Jones algorithm is that it is **really fast**. It can run on low-powered processors and that's what made it possible to build face 
detection into early cameras and made a huge impact on the industry when it was first invented. 
* But the disadvantage is that is **not very accurate** and it tends to have a lot of false positives. Better algorithms now exist that are much more 
reliable. 
* Because of this, there's no reason to use it anymore unless you're working with very low-powdered devices. 

## **Histogram of Oriented Gradients or HOG Algorithm**
* This approach was invented in 2005 but it still works pretty well and it doesn't require any special hardware to run. 
* HOG looks for patterns and how fast and in what directions images shift from light to dark colors.
* Slower than Viola-Jones but more accurate.
* Runs well on normal computers without special hardware.

## **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
* This is the deep learning approach to detecting faces. 
* It's the most accurate approach of the three but it requires a lot of training data to train the face detection neural network. 
* It will run very slowly unless your computer has a video card with a GPU to offload the processing. But if you have the right hardware to run it, this is another good choice.
